# Turing Machine Emulator

This is a Java project that emulates a Turing machine. The project includes an implementation of a Turing machine and a tape, which uses a doubly linked list data structure.

## Usage

To run the Turing machine emulator, run the `App.java` file. This file runs the other files in the project, including some tests for the functionality.

The `Tape.java` file is responsible for emulating a Turing tape. It uses a doubly linked list data structure to represent the tape, and provides methods such as `unshiftCell`, `pushCell`, `moveLeft`, `moveRight`, and `getTapeContents` to manipulate the tape.

## Note

Please note that all files in this project folder, except for `App.java` and `Tape.java`, correspond to University of the People. These files are included for educational purposes only and should not be used for any commercial or other purposes.
