# Fibonacci Calculator

This is a simple Java program that calculates the value of the Fibonacci sequence at a given index. The program takes an integer input from the user and returns the corresponding Fibonacci number.

## Usage

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/xllWhiteReaper/java/tree/develop`
2. Switch branches by using the following command: `git checkout develop`
3. Navigate to the following folder: `programming_2/fibonacci_recursion`
4. Open the project in your IDE (Integrated Development Environment) of choice
5. Build the project using the `F5` key or the integrated IDE runner. Else, run the code provided on the Getting Started section

## Getting Started

To run the program, you need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Java from the official website: https://www.java.com/en/download/

Once you have Java installed, you can compile and run the program using the following commands:

```
javac App.java
java App
```

This will compile and run the Fibonacci.java file, which contains the main program logic.

## Usage

When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter an integer value for the index of the Fibonacci sequence that you want to calculate. You can enter any non-negative integer value.

The program will then calculate the corresponding Fibonacci number and print it to the console.

## Implementation Details

The program uses a recursive algorithm to calculate the Fibonacci sequence. This algorithm is simple and easy to understand, but it can be slow for larger index values.

To improve performance, you can use an iterative algorithm or store the previously calculated Fibonacci numbers in an array or a map to avoid redundant calculations.
